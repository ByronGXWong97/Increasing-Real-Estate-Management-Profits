# Increasing-Real-Estate-Management-Profits
This is my submission for the Capstone Project of the Coursera Specialization "Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business" offered by Duke University. The objective of the project is to convince the fictitious property management company to increase its profits by converting some of their properties to short-term rental properties. Firstly, I used MySQL to extract relevant data from a real estate database. I then used Excel to identify opportunities to increase revenue, maximise profits and manage risks. Finally, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to perform sensitivity analysis.
